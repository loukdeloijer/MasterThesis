# MasterThesis

Hi, welcome to the github page with the notebooks that show several aspects of my master thesis. 

In my thesis I tested the capabilities of zero-shot image and language models in the e-commerce environment by comparing the capabilities of CLIP in apparel category classification and feature extraction. Moreover, I generated product descriptions with GPT-3. Next, I ran two human experiments, One to obtain human evaluations for the generated product descriptions and to test whether partipants were able to distinguish the human-written product descriptions from the GPT-3 product descriptions. 

This repository contains four notebooks, each related to a different aspect of my thesis. 

1. the CLIP notebook tests the capabilities of CLIP in feature extraction and product classification. 
2. the ProductDescriptionGenerationGPT-3 notebook contains the code that generates the product descriptions with a zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot and finetune method. 
3. The SurveyAnalysisFinal notebook processes the human evaluations given to the generated product descriptions and conducts several statistical tests to support the hypothesis made in the thesis. 
4. The SurveyAnalysisPurchaseIntention process the respones given in the purchase intentione experiment and conducts several statistical tests to support the hypotheses made regarding the purchase intention of participants in the master thesis.
